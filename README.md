# From TDD to Property Based Testing

This repository contains the way I do tdd on fizzBuzz and add property based tests by listening to my unit tests.

## How to use this repo

This a presentation I usually live code. In order to allow you to have an experience as similar as possible, I commited each steps so you can go through the presentation as if it was live.
The comments I usually said will be in the commit logs.
Each step is tag as `step-XX` where `XX` is the number of the step.
So, in order to go to a step, you just have checkout the tag.
Begin with :
```
git checkout step-00
```


## Warning

FizzBuzz is a *really* simple problem. I do know that. And it will resolved in a flaw in my tests : it will almost duplicate the implementation. 
That being said, when I live code this, I generally have only one hour.
